		<h2 id="accessibility-statement-for-website-name">Accessibility statement for [website name]</h2>
		<p>This website is run by [name of organisation]. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
		  <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
		  <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
		  <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
		  <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
		<p><a rel="external" href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

		<h3 id="how-accessible-this-website-is">How accessible this website is</h3>
		<p>We know some parts of this website aren’t fully accessible:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>the text won’t reflow in a single column when you change the size of the browser window</li>
		  <li>you can’t modify the line height or spacing of text</li>
		  <li>most older PDF documents aren’t fully accessible to screen reader software</li>
		  <li>live video streams don’t have captions</li>
		  <li>some of our online forms are difficult to navigate using just a keyboard</li>
		  <li>you can’t skip to the main content when using a screen reader</li>
		  <li>there’s a limit to how far you can magnify the map on our ‘contact us’ page</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="what-to-do-if-you-cant-access-parts-of-this-website">What to do if you can’t access parts of this website</h3>

		<h3 id="reporting-accessibility-problems-with-this-website">Reporting accessibility problems with this website</h3>
		<p>We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this website. If you find any problems that aren’t listed on this page or think we’re not meeting accessibility requirements, contact: [provide details of how to report these issues to your organisation, and contact details for the unit or person responsible for dealing with these reports].</p>

		<h3 id="enforcement-procedure">Enforcement procedure</h3>
		<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a rel="external" href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/">contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="technical-information-about-this-websites-accessibility">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
		<p>[Name of organisation] is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
		<p>This website is fully compliant with the <a rel="external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard.</p>
		<p>This website is partially compliant with the <a rel="external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.</p>
		<p>This website is not compliant with the <a rel="external" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard. The non-accessible sections are listed below.</p>

		<h2 id="non-accessible-content">Non accessible content</h2>
		<p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

		<h3 id="non-compliance-with-the-accessibility-regulations">Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
		<p>Some images don’t have a text alternative, so the information in them isn’t available to people using a screen reader. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-text content).</p>
		<p>We plan to add text alternatives for all images by September 2020. When we publish new content we’ll make sure our use of images meets accessibility standards.</p>

		<h3 id="disproportionate-burden">Disproportionate burden</h3>
		<h4 id="navigation-and-accessing-information">Navigation and accessing information</h4>
		<p>There’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main content’ option). This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1 (bypass blocks).</p>
		<p>It’s not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.4 (orientation).</p>
		<p>It’s not possible for users to change text size without some of the content overlapping. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.4.4 (resize text).</p>
		<h4 id="interactive-tools-and-transactions">Interactive tools and transactions</h4>
		<p>Some of our interactive forms are difficult to navigate using a keyboard. For example, because some form controls are missing a ‘label’ tag.</p>
		<p>Our forms are built and hosted through third party software and ‘skinned’ to look like our website. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (information and relationships).</p>
		<p>We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information, and with interactive tools and transactions. We believe that doing so now would be a <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made">disproportionate burden</a> within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will make another assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely to be in [rough timing].</p>

		<h3 id="content-thats-not-within-the-scope-of-the-accessibility-regulations">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
		<h4 id="pdfs-and-other-documents">PDFs and other documents</h4>
		<p>Many of our older PDFs and Word documents don’t meet accessibility standards - for example, they may not be structured so they’re accessible to a screen reader. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 4.1.2 (name, role value).</p>
		<p>Some of our PDFs and Word documents are essential to providing our services. For example, we have PDFs with information on how users can access our services, and forms published as Word documents. By September 2020, we plan to either fix these or replace them with accessible HTML pages.</p>
		<p>The accessibility regulations <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made">don’t require us to fix PDFs or other documents published before 23 September 2018</a> if they’re not essential to providing our services. For example, we don’t plan to fix [example of non-essential document].</p>
		<p>Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.</p>
		<h4 id="live-video">Live video</h4>
		<p>Live video streams don’t have captions. This doesn’t meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.2.4 (captions - live).</p>
		<p>We don’t plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is <a rel="external" href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/4/made">exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="how-we-tested-this-website">How we tested this website</h2>
		<p>This website was last tested on [date]. The test was carried out by [add name of organisation that carried out test, or indicate that you did your own testing].</p>

		<p>We tested:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>our main website platform, available at [url]</li>
		  <li>our campaign microsites, available at [url], [url] and [url]</li>
		  <li>[service name], [service name] and [service name] - services based on a different technical platform but ‘skinned’ to look like our website</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You can read the full accessibility test report [add link to report].</p>
